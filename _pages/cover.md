I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University. I am on the 2024-2025 PhD Accounting Job Market. 

I use archival methods to examine issues related to financial accounting. My research interests lie in the production, dissemination, and use of value-relevant information. Specifically, I study factors that influence how managers produce information, how infomediaries disseminate information, and how investors use information. I specialize in applying big data techniques and advanced AI models to analyze value-relevant information that is unstructured (such as text, audio, and images).

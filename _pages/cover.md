I am an assistant professor in the Business School at National University of Singapore.

I hold a Ph.D. in accounting from Cornell University. In my research, I use archival methods to examine issues related to financial accounting. My research interests lie in the dynamics of information transmission in markets and firms. Specifically, I examine the transmission of information among capital market participants, such as managers, infomediaries, and investors, as well as the transmission of information among the workforce within firms.

I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at SC Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University. I am on the 2024-2025 Ph.D. Accounting Job Market, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. 

I use archival methods to examine issues related to financial accounting. My research interests lie in the dynamics of information transmission in markets and firms. Specifically, I examine the transmission of information among capital market participants, such as managers, infomediaries, and investors, as well as the transmission of information among the workforce within firms.

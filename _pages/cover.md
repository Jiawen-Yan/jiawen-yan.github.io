Jiawen Yan is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at Johnson College of Business, Cornell University. 

Jiawen's research interests lie in understanding the production, dissemination, and use of value-relevant information that is “unstructured”, meaning that it is not simply a labeled number (like Earnings Per Share = $3.27) or categorization (like Audit Opinion = Unqualified). Unstructured information includes text, images, and video in various settings such as 10-K, earnings calls, analyst reports, and media. Prior to joining the Cornell Ph.D. program in 2020, Jiawen received his B.S. in economics from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and received his joint M.S. in management from Tsinghua and Columbia University.

**Introduction**

The goal of this course is to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of financial accounting. Financial accounting information is commonly used by investors, regulators, customers, and suppliers. Investors include individual shareholders and bondholders, institutional investors (e.g., mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity firms), lenders (e.g., banks), and potential corporate acquirers. Regulators, such as the SEC, routinely review financial accounting information. Financial accounting information also plays a significant role in managerial performance evaluations and day-to-day business decisions.


The focus of this course will be on training you to be a knowledgeable consumer of accounting information, rather than a producer of such information. We will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of financial accounting information. We feel that a firm grasp of the fundamental mechanics is necessary to become an effective consumer of financial accounting information. Along the way, we will emphasize the uses and limitations of financial accounting information.


Accounting is often described as the “language of business.” Anyone who expects to belong to an organization in which financial information is used to make decisions will benefit from this course. This includes students who plan to work in industry, investment banking, consulting, non-profits, governments, and anyone who plans to invest or take an active role in their retirement planning. In addition to financial accounting knowledge, we will convey some general business intuition, and will discuss how operational decisions affect financial accounting numbers.


Finally, this course is designed as an introductory course, aimed primarily at students with NO prior academic preparation in accounting.
